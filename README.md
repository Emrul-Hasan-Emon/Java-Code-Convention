<h3><b>Chapter - 1: Why are Code Conventions necessary?<b></h3>h3>

When a programmer builds a software, it is not guaranteed that this software will be maintained by that programmer for life time. Other programmers may need to update this software or maintain the software. At that time the important fact arises is to understand the code. So, it is necessary to do the coding in such a way so that another programmer can understand. Besides, 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance. So, we can understand that the maximum cost goes on maintenance. Thatâ€™s why it  is necessary to follow a standard way for that so that another one can understand. This standard way is known as Code Conventions.

Code Conventions improve the readability of the software. It allows engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
